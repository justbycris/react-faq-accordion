# react-faq-accordion
FAQ accordion challenge from Frontend Mentor. Even though I had done this one with HTML, CSS, JS, I decided to make it now with React since I'm learning it. 

A few things I enjoyed:
• I feel like I finally understand useState hooks and how they work. I feel very powerful! 
• It was a nice introduction to see how to manipulate the DOM.
• Using props and passing object properties. 

I had a lot of fun, it took me 2 days, and suddenly React doesn't feel as heavy as it did when I started. I will keep doing frontend mentor challenges, first with JavaScript and then redoing them with React.
